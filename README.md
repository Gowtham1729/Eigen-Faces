# FACE RECOGNITION USING EIGEN FACES
This is a Face Recognition algorithm designed to detect faces in real time. This approach is fast enough to implement it on real time. This approach is based on the paper [Face recognition using eigenfaces by Matthew A. Turk and Alex P. Pentland](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/139758)

[The YaleFaces Dataset](https://vismod.media.mit.edu/vismod/classes/mas622-00/datasets/) is used for training and testing the algorithm.

## Development
This paper is implemented in python3.

Python packages used for the implementation are:
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. sklearn

To install these packages run the following code
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

All the Ipython notebooks are self explanatory
